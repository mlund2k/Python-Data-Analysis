## Bike Share Analysis
This Python notebook exploratory data analysis project explored the conditions and trends of London bike share data pulled during mostly 2015 and 2016. Exploration delved into the relationshipes between the number of bike purchases and a multitude of metrics including weather, temperature, humidity, and more.

This analysis takes place within Kaggle Notebook through the development of code to clean, structure, and visualize the data. The resulting report can be viewed below:
